    "- The collaborative system will recommend items based on the ratings of other users. This system will compare beer drinker/reviewer profiles and then recommend items based on the similarity between these users. \n"

    "As of December of 2021 there are more than [9,000 breweries](https://vinepair.com/booze-news/us-record-number-breweries-2021/#:~:text=Even%20after%20the%20setbacks%20of,beer%20producers%20in%20the%20U.S.) in the US alone. There are so many options on the market that choosing which beverage to buy next, what brewery to visit in person, or which booth to stand in line for at a festival can seem overwhelming. The craft beer business is still booming even after the pandemic and customers should know they can enjoy their next sip (or pint) with confidence. My target audience could be any of the hundred of thousands of people that enjoy beer and trying new breweries! The domain knowledge I am relying on is personal as I myself am a sometimes indecisive) beer enthusiast who has tried over 1,000 beers and visited approximately 100 breweries."
