    "As of December of 2021 there are more than [9,000 breweries](https://vinepair.com/booze-news/us-record-number-breweries-2021/#:~:text=Even%20after%20the%20setbacks%20of,beer%20producers%20in%20the%20U.S.) in the US alone. There are so many options on the market that choosing which beverage to buy next, what brewery to visit in person, or which booth to stand in line for at a festival can seem overwhelming. The craft beer business is still booming even after the pandemic and customers should know they can enjoy their next sip (or pint) with confidence. My target audience could be any of the hundred of thousands of people that enjoy beer and trying new breweries! The domain knowledge I am relying on is personal as I myself am a sometimes indecisive) beer enthusiast who has tried over 1,000 beers and visited approximately 100 breweries."

    "### Tasting Profiles\n",
    "The [first dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephenpolozoff/top-beer-information?select=beer_data_set.csv) contains data scraped from the website [BeerAdvocate.com](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). It is a CSV file that contains 5,558 beers in total across 112 styles. Other data represented in the table includes: the brewery the beer was produced, a description of the beer, and the overall rating of the beer. As there is no unique user review data, this dataset would be best for a content based recommendation system. \n",

    "### Beer Reviews \n",
    "The [second dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdoume/beerreviews) is also scraped from [BeerAdvocate.com](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). It is a CSV file that contains approximately 1.6 million reviews of beers from their website. There are a total of 33,388 unique reviewers and 56,857 unique beers that have been reviewed. There are no descriptions of the beers, just names, brewery, style, and ratings on a scale of 1 - 5. Because this data set has both unique users and beer IDs it lends itself to be a collaborative filtering system.   \n",

    "#### Binning Styles\n",
    "There were initially 112 different styles. In order to streamline recommendations and decrease feature complexity I will be combining similar styles together based on the [BeerAdvocate’s Style Guide](https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/styles/). For example a category on the site is “Brown Ales” with the different variations listed below.![brownale.png](attachment:brownale.png)\n",
    "The idea is that if a person likes one type of brown ale (say an Altbier)  they are likely to enjoy another within this category. I created a style dictionary that I will map each 112 subcategories to their 17 main categories. Binning by name of **Style** will simplify this feature, but each unique subcategory will be preserved in the **Style Key** feature. "
