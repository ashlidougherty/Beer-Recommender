# Cheers! A Beer Recommendation System: A Content and Collaborative Approach

Author: Ashli Dougherty 

# Overview
This project's goal is to build a recommendation system for the beer enthusiast. I am interested in creating both a content based and collaborative filtering recommendation system. 
- A content based system will make recommendations based on a beer's features. The content based system will allow any user to enter the name of a beer and in return they will be given the names of other beers they will (hopefully) enjoy drinking.  
- The collaborative system will recommend items based on the ratings of other users. This system will compare beer reviewer profiles and then recommend beers based on predicted ratings from the similarity between these users. 


# Business Problem
As of December 2021, there are more than [9,000 breweries](https://vinepair.com/booze-news/us-record-number-breweries-2021/#:~:text=Even%20after%20the%20setbacks%20of,beer%20producers%20in%20the%20U.S.) in the US alone. Even though some taprooms were forced to shut their doors during the pandemic, the craft beer business is still going strong. The [Brewerâ€™s Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/) is expecting an increase in craft brewery volume share in the post-pandemic industry market, and reported that craft beer retail sales were over $26 billion dollars in 2021.    
  
Currently, there are mobile apps (like [Untapped](https://untappd.com/)) and websites (like [Beer Advocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)) that allow you to personally track and rate the beer you try, but consumers should know they can enjoy their next sip (or pint) with confidence. There are so many options on the market that choosing which beverage to buy next, what brewery to visit in person, or which booth to stand in line for at a festival can seem overwhelming. My goal is to provide a system for beer enthusiasts to try new beers that they are guaranteed to love. Cheers!


# Data
## Data Understanding
There are two datasets being utilized for this project.

### Tasting Profiles
The [first dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stephenpolozoff/top-beer-information?select=beer_data_set.csv) contains data scraped from the website [BeerAdvocate.com](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). It is a CSV file that contains 5,558 beers in total across 112 styles. Other data represented in the table includes: the brewery the beer was produced, a description of the beer, and the overall rating of the beer. As there is no unique user review data, this dataset would be best for a content-based recommendation system. 

### Beer Reviews 
The [second dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rdoume/beerreviews) is also scraped from [BeerAdvocate.com](https://www.beeradvocate.com/). It is a CSV file that contains approximately 1.6 million reviews of beers from their website. There are a total of 33,388 unique reviewers and 56,857 unique beers that have been reviewed. There are no descriptions of the beers, just names, brewery, style, and ratings on a scale of 1 - 5. Because this data set has both unique users and beer IDs it lends itself to be a user to user collaborative filtering system.   

Due to the large size of these datasets I downloaded them locally and saved to an external repository outside of github.

## Data Preparation 
### Content Based
For the tasting profiles dataset I cleaned using built in pandas methods and functions. Duplicates, entries that were missing descriptions, beers with ABVs above 15% were dropped from the dataset as part of the cleaning process. Styles were binned from 112 to the main 17 from the BeerAdvocate website. Some beers initially had the same name, but are from different breweries. In order to preserve these entries I added the name of the brewry in front of the beers that had generic names.

Below are the types of beers represented in the dataset and the range of ratings.

For data preparation and cleaning I primarily used built-in pandas methods and functions. The meta data was heavily cleaned to extract relevant information for this project including author, genre, page lengths, and kindle features. Meta data and review data was matched using 'asin' field, a unique product ID number generated by Amazon. As this project was focused soley on eBooks, I removed any products that did not match this. Review data was truncate to only included verified reviews, removing any potential paid sponsor reviews which could be skewed positively.
