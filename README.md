# Cheers! A Beer Recommendation System: A Content and Collaborative Approach

Author: Ashli Dougherty 

# Overview
This project's goal is to build a recommendation system for the beer enthusiast. I am interested in creating both a content based and collaborative filtering recommendation system. 
- A content based system will make recommendations based on a beer's features. The content based system will allow any user to enter the name of a beer and in return they will be given the names of other beers they will (hopefully) enjoy drinking.  
- The collaborative system will recommend items based on the ratings of other users. This system will compare beer reviewer profiles and then recommend beers based on predicted ratings from the similarity between these users. 


# Business Problem
As of December 2021, there are more than [9,000 breweries](https://vinepair.com/booze-news/us-record-number-breweries-2021/#:~:text=Even%20after%20the%20setbacks%20of,beer%20producers%20in%20the%20U.S.) in the US alone. Even though some taprooms were forced to shut their doors during the pandemic, the craft beer business is still going strong. The [Brewerâ€™s Association](https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/national-beer-stats/) is expecting an increase in craft brewery volume share in the post-pandemic industry market, and reported that craft beer retail sales were over $26 billion dollars in 2021.    
  
Currently, there are mobile apps (like [Untapped](https://untappd.com/)) and websites (like [Beer Advocate](https://www.beeradvocate.com/)) that allow you to personally track and rate the beer you try, but consumers should know they can enjoy their next sip (or pint) with confidence. There are so many options on the market that choosing which beverage to buy next, what brewery to visit in person, or which booth to stand in line for at a festival can seem overwhelming. My goal is to provide a system for beer enthusiasts to try new beers that they are guaranteed to love. Cheers!
